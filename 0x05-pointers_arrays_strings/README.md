A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes : A C function that reverses a string.
Prototype: void rev_string(char *s);
Compile the code this way: gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 5-main.c 5-rev_string.c -o 5-rev_string
Half the lies they tell about me aren't true : A C function program that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void puts2(char *str);
Compile the code this way: gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 _putchar.c 6-main.c 6-puts2.c -o 6-puts2
Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half : A C function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void puts_half(char *str);
The function should print the second half of the string.
If the number of characters is odd, the function should print the last n characters of the string where n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2)
Compile the code this way: gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 _putchar.c 7-main.c 7-puts_half.c -o 7-puts_half
